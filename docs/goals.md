# Goals
1. Provide reliability and predictability above all
2. Provide an API consistent with JavaScript/Node.js semantics
3. Simplify using `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` from a Node.js app
4. Be cross-platform, the library should produce the same outcome on all platforms
5. Provide flexibility for more complex use cases

# Non-Goals
1. Support old JavaScript environments, only LTS releases of Node.js are supported
2. Build features based on format/codec/etc. detection
