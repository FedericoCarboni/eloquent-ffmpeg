# Eloquent FFmpeg
Eloquent FFmpeg simplifies interactions with
[FFmpeg command line tools](https://ffmpeg.org/) into a simple yet powerful API.
It's still in a very early stage, but there should be no breaking changes.
If something's missing or broken feel free to open an issue or a pull request to
see your feature added or bug fixed.

**Only NodeJS 10.x or higher is supported**
